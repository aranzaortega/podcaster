## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following tools installed on your system:

- Node.js (Recommended version: LTS)
- npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-folder>
   ```

2. Install dependencies using npm or yarn:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

## Development Mode

To run the app in development mode, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder.

2. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

3. The development server will start, and you'll see an output indicating the local server address (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).

4. Open your web browser and navigate to the provided local server address. You should see your React app running in development mode.

5. Start coding! The development server supports hot module replacement, so your changes will automatically reflect in the browser without needing a full page reload.

## Production Mode

To build and run the app in production mode locally, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder.

2. Build the production-ready bundle:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   # or
   yarn build
   ```

3. After the build is complete, you'll find the optimized files in the `dist` or `build` directory.

4. Install a simple server like `serve` globally (if not installed already):

   ```bash
   npm install -g serve
   ```

5. Run the production build using the `serve` command:

   ```bash
   serve -s dist
   ```

6. Open your web browser and navigate to the provided local server address. You should see your React app running in production mode.

## Deploying to Production

To deploy your React app to a production server, you can follow these general steps:

1. Choose a hosting provider for your app (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, AWS, etc.).

2. Set up your hosting account and configure the deployment settings according to the provider's instructions.

3. Connect your hosting account to your project repository (if applicable).

4. Configure any environment variables or build settings required for your hosting provider.

5. Push your code changes to the chosen repository.

6. The hosting provider will automatically build and deploy your app based on your settings.

Remember to refer to the documentation of your chosen hosting provider for specific deployment instructions.

That's it! You've successfully set up and deployed your React app created with Vite. Happy coding! ðŸš€
